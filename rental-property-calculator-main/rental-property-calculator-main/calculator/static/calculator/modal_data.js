var closing_costs =
  "<p>When someone purchases a property, there are numerous costs and fees associated with the transaction. Enter one cumulative number here to add closing costs. Typical closing costs are around 2-5% of the purchase price of the property but can differ depending on location and financing. If unsure, 2.5% of the purchase price is a good number to begin with. Keep in mind, typically this 2-5% does not include points charged by the lender for obtaining your loan, which you’ll be able to enter below in the “Loan details” section.</p>";

var prop_val_growth =
  "<p>Over time, a property’s value increases due to a combination of inflation and local market dynamics. On average, American real estate has appreciated between 2 and 3% per year over the past 100 years. This calculator defaults to a 2% property growth, but you can choose to adjust this number to whatever you believe is most accurate for your market and property.</p>";

var down_payment =
  "<p>When purchasing a rental property, most investors obtain a loan from a bank, credit union, or another lender. Although down payment requirements change based on numerous factors, most loans require between 20% and 30% of the purchase price for a down payment. Adjust the down payment in this section to match the type of loan you'll obtain. If you plan to purchase your rental property by paying all cash, and using no loan, simply check the 'Cash purchase' box.</p>";

var down_payment_2 =
  "<p>When purchasing a rental property, most investors obtain a loan from a bank, credit union, or another lender. Although down payment requirements change based on numerous factors, most loans require between 20% and 30% of the purchase price for a down payment. Adjust the down payment in this section to match the type of loan you'll obtain. If you plan to purchase your rental property by paying all cash, and using no loan, simply check the 'Cash purchase' box.</p>";

var loan_points =
  '<p>Often when you take out a loan, you will pay "points" (aka: fees) on the loan. One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. For example, a $100,000 loan with 2 points would be $2,000.</p><p>This website has a good detailed explanation of how loan points work and whether or not they are right for you:</p><a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/home-ownership/buying-mortgage-points-lower-rate" target=_blank>Better Money Habits: Bank of America</a>';

var loan_term =
  '<p>A loan term is the length of time that which a loan is scheduled to be paid back. The longer the time frame, the lower the monthly loan payment. In residential real estate, such as single-family or small multifamily properties, 30-year mortgages are most common—though many do opt for a 15-year mortgage. In commercial real estate, 20 or 25-year mortgages are more common. Keep in mind that some mortgages may have a "balloon payment". This type of payment is when a loan is spread out over a long term (like 30 years), but the entire balance is due at some predetermined point (like 7 years.) If this is the case with your loan, be sure to put the length of time the loan is amortized over, ignoring the balloon payment. Talk to your lender to find what is most common in your area.</p>';

var gross_monthly_income =
  "<p>Gross monthly income is the total amount of rent you could receive on the property if it is 100% occupied. You can enter this number in the field for “Gross monthly income”.</p>";

var rent =
  "<p>The rent of a property is largely dictated by location but can be influenced by the property itself. In other words, although the average rent in a neighborhood might be, for example, $1,000 a month, a nicer property may get slightly more though the rent will still fall within a range. There are three primary strategies you can use to discover the average rent of an area:</p><ol><li><strong>Comparable Rents</strong>: Take a look at what similar properties are renting for in a given area. You can use Craigslist, Zillow, or The Facebook Marketplace to find listings in your area, or you can ask a real estate agent for rental listings.</li><li><strong>Property Manager</strong>: Local property managers rent dozens or even hundreds of homes each month, which means they have a solid idea of the rental rate possibilities in your market. Call several property managers to get their opinions.</li><li><strong>Online Tools</strong>:  There are several online tools that can help you estimate a property's potential rent including <a href='https://www.rentometer.com' target=_blank>Rentometer</a>. These tools rely on data and algorithms to determine a property's rent estimate but always double-check with either a property manager or by reviewing comps to ensure that the specifics of your property are properly accounted for in the rent estimate. Your property may be slightly higher or lower than what an online tool may predict.</li></ol>";

var income_growth =
  "<p>Over time, rent tends to increase due to inflation and supply/demand dynamics of a given market. For reference, rents in the United States increased 3.83% per year between 1980 and 2018, rising from a median rent of $243 in 1980 to $1,012 in 2018. Of course, past performance doesn't guarantee the same in the future. The default setting in this calculator is 2%, though you can change that to reflect your opinion on the future growth of rents.</p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href='https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/coh-grossrents.html' target=_blank>Census Data</a></p><p><a href='https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/us/' target=_blank>Department of Numbers<a/></p>";

var taxes =
  "<p>The government makes a sizable portion of its revenue from taxes levied on property owners. Some areas of the country have surprisingly low property tax rates (Denver, for example), while other areas have exceptionally high rates (the northeast, for example). To determine your rental's property taxes, you can use one of the following two methods:</p><ol><li><strong>The Listing</strong>: If the property is listed by a real estate agent, you can ask your agent about the current tax bill. Often this information is displayed on the online listing as well, such as on <a href='https://www.zillow.com' target=_blank>Zillow.com</a> or <a href='https://www.realtor.com' target=_blank>Realtor.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Public data</strong>: In the United States, property tax information is public data, and details on current and historical tax records can be found on your County Assessor's Website. Simply look around the website for a place to search 'tax records'.</li></ol><p>Keep in mind, property taxes may increase after you purchase a property, so always check with your local county or an experienced real estate agent to estimate what your future tax liability could be.</p>";

var insurance =
  "<p>Insurance costs differ greatly depending on location, property type, and property condition. To determine your property's insurance costs, talk with a local or online insurance agent to get a quote. Of course, the more deals you analyze in a given area, the more you'll get a feel for what's normal.</p><p>Keep in mind, some areas require extra insurance, such as flood, hurricane, or earthquake insurance. Talk to your real estate agent, your lender, or your insurance agent to determine if you need these specialty insurance policies. And, when obtaining insurance quotes, don't forget to let the insurance agent know this is for an investment property.</p>";

var maintenance =
  "<p>All properties require ongoing maintenance when things break (and with tenants - they will). This number is usually expressed as a percentage of the rent. Although repairs will depend on numerous factors such as the location and age of the property; typical repair costs tend to be between 5-15% of the gross monthly rent.</p>";

var vacancy =
  "<p>Vacancy rate is the cost of the property sitting empty due to tenant turnover. This number can vary depending on the area, so consult with a local property manager or landlord as to the local norms. Typical vacancy rates are between 3%-10% of the gross monthly rent, but again, that can depend on the area.</p>";

var cap_ex =
  "<p>CapEx, short for capital expenditures, are the large less-than-frequent improvements done to a property such as roofs, parking lots, siding, or appliances. CapEx will depend on numerous factors such as property type, the location of the property, and the age of the property. Typically, many investors allocate between 5 and 15% of the rent for CapEx.</p>";

var property_management =
  "<p>How much does a local property manager charge to manage the property each month? This number is usually expressed as a percentage. This rate may differ based on location and property type, but typical rates hover between 7-12% of the gross monthly rent.</p>";

var monhtly_expenses =
  "<p>There's more to estimating rental expenses than simply paying back the loan. Maintaining the property, paying insurance and taxes, and other property management costs must be considered to calculate a rental's cash flow.</p><p>Every area and property is different as to what expenses are paid by the landlord and what is paid by the tenant. The more deals you analyze in your market, the more comfortable you'll become with estimating these charges. In the beginning, however, you'll likely need to pick up the phone and make some calls to the electric company, water department, and garbage collections. They may not give you specifics for your property, but they can offer some pricing guidance.</p>";

var hoa =
  "<p>Some areas, especially condo complexes or higher-income neighborhoods, are controlled by a homeowners association (HOA), usually run by members of the community. These HOAs create rules and regulations around what can and cannot be done to a property within its jurisdiction and sometimes provide certain services and shared spaces or amenities like pools and roofs (in the case of condos). HOA fees can range from a few dollars a month to thousands of dollars per month, based on the community or location. Be sure to check and see if your property is located within an HOA and, if so, ask your real estate agent what the monthly HOA fees are.</p>";
